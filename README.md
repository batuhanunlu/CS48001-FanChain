# E-Voting Application for CS48001 Blockchain Project

## Explanation
Voting is a crucial event that needs to be handled very carefully. There are some specific criterias that we need to consider. These are such as privacy, eligibility, convenience and verifiability. In terms of privacy, voterâ€™s decisions should be kept secret. For eligibility, the process of voting should occur only once per every single user. When it comes to convenience, the voting should be a simple process. For verifiability, the result must be consistent with the votes. These criterias can be met with blockchain technology, and in our project we wish to turn this secure voting system into a fan service where fans can vote and be eligible for the amount of points they receive based on the time of their voting. We believe this system can be implemented in many sports such as NBA, F1, NFL etc.

## Problem and Definition of Requirement
- Questioning the authenticity of the voting system.
- Missing votes distorts the integrity of results of the votes.
- Double voting may cause unfair results.
- Predicting who will be winning the game or race towards the end of it is easier compared to when it is just starting. Predictions that are made the earliest are the hardest.

## Original value
Unbiased, fair and scalable voting platform for Formula 1.

## Widespread Impact
- It can influence organizations such as e-sports competitions, NBA, Premier League, NFL, football leagues to use our system for predicting the winners.
- With the data we obtain at the end of the voting, the collected data can be used in data research.
- Can be used as a statistical source for sports investors and casinos.
